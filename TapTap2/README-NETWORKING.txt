What I've Done:
TapTap2:
included the socket.io library in the gradle file
established client connection to the socket.io server 
client receives a unique id when it establishes connection with the server generated by socket.io
all clients other than the new client also get notified if a new client establishes connection with the server 

5. DRAWING CONNECTED PLAYERS 
created Starship Sprite Class
in create(): playership, friendlyship texture classes are initialized
dispose(): texture classes are disposed 
configSocketEvents(): when client is connected, starship sprite is created 
render(): if client is connected, the starship sprite is drawn 
keeps a hashmap of all other players connected (hashmap of id and starship sprite)
configSocketEvents(): when a new player joins, store the player's id in the hashmap and create a new sprite for the id
render(): for every key in the hashmap, draw the ids' starship sprite
